**Automate-The-Boring-Stuff**

**Welcome! Over 6 months I worked with this book and I keep working with it. Automate The Boring Stuff taught me the Fundamentals of Programming.**

I do not see Automate The Boring Stuff as a quick sprint. I realized when I learn new concepts and immediately build my own projects I end up getting way more out of this book than just rushing through the exercises. I also make changes to the Practice Projects to make them slightly more complex. In this way I always keep pushing it forward and I expand my skill level.



**I made a commitment to publish all my work, document my entire journey so other people can learn from my mistakes.This repository is my official start.**
