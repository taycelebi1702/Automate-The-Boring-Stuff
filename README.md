Automate-The-Boring-Stuff
Welcome! Over 6 months I worked with this book. Automate The Boring Stuff taught me the Fundamentals of Programming.
In my opinion this is the best book to learn Python. In this Repository I decided to publish all my projects from this book.
I made a commitment to myself to publish all my work, document my entire journey so other people can learn from my mistakes. This repository is my official start.
